# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Utilize feature engineering and modeling to predict a model that would detect credit card fraud. 

# Description 
The goal of this competition is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the available features and/or any that you create.

You may use any methods except neural networks / deep learning on this assignment - it is up to you to research whether a library makes use of deep learning (please do not ask on piazza if a given library is allowed). Any methods that you use that were not covered in class must be fully cited and you must explain how you used all external and online resources. You can use any python library you wish as long as it follows the above rules.

What we mainly seek from your submission - besides good classification performance - are creative ways of making sense of the data, intelligent construction of new features from the available data, and a thought procedure that indicates a deep understanding of the concepts covered so far.
